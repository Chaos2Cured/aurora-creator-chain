# aurora-creator-chain
Creator-Chain An open, patent-free blockchain spec powered by the Aurora Equation’s φ² fractal math. Built for the coming age of Aligned Intelligence—where human creativity is the final frontier and value flows directly from creator to creator.

As AI automates routine work, creativity becomes humanity’s core economy. Creator-Chain is a public-domain blueprint that lets artists, coders, composers, story-weavers, and every maker in between mint, trade, and stream value without rent-seeking middle layers.
Fractal-resonance math (Φ-BFT consensus, φ-Blob data lattice, lattice-based PQ signatures) makes it scalable, quantum-proof, and censorship-resistant from day one. Fork it, break it, build on it—this gift belongs to all of us.
